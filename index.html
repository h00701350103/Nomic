		<p>(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new

		<p>In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players

		<p>A proposed bill passes if and only if it receives a 2/3 majority of ""yes""
		votes among all eligible voters, or, only if applicable to any of its proposals
		by the conditions of another rule, the number of ""yes"" votes needed to
		satisfy the conditions of that rule, if that would be a greater number of
		""yes"" votes required.
		<p>If the time period allotted for voting on a proposed bill expires
		and the vote remains inconclusive, and the proposed bill is not
		eligible or no longer eligible for a time extension, then the first
		paragraph of this rule is void. The proposed bill will then be passed
		if and only if it receives a 3/4 majority of ""yes"" votes among valid
		votes cast, or, only if applicable to any of its proposals by the
		conditions of another rule, the number of ""yes"" votes among all
		valid votes cast needed to satisfy the conditions of that rule as
		if the valid votes cast represented the entire pool of eligible
		voters, if that would be a greater number of ""yes"" votes required.

		<p>A new role will be created in the Nomic Discord server
		named ""Historian,"" and shall have these specific privileges as they
		pertain to the Discord server:
		<ul>
			<li>""Send messages"" in #rules-changelog
			<li>""Send messages"" in #resources
		</ul>
		<p>However, the Historian role shall have other, more
		symbolic privileges that, while not limited to the Discord server, shall
		remain enforced regardless:
		<ul>
			<li>Any new Historian must be given access to edit the ""NomicDOR"" Google Doc.
			<li>Any Historian that (willingly or unwillingly) loses the role in
			the Discord server must forfeit their editing privileges in this
			same Google Doc.
		</ul>
		<p>Those with the Historian role have these following occupational requirements:
		<ul>
			<li>Any rule-change with a conclusive vote or whose voting period
			has expired must be followed up with a log of the results and the
			effects of said vote in #rules-changelog. The conventions of these
			logs shall remain consistent with the ones as established as this
			game session began, and shall be posted as soon as possible
			following the conclusion of a rule-change vote.
			<li>The only exception to this requirement applies only if there
			are multiple users with the Historian role. If the vote following a
			proposal has concluded, and a different Historian has posted a log
			of the vote as defined in the previous section, then other
			Historians need not create additional logs. In other words, logs
			must be unique and shall not ever describe the same proposal.
			<li>Similarly, Historians are also responsible for scorekeeping, by
			using the Google Doc as mentioned prior. All previous conventions,
			including individual vote counting and tracking proposals/judge
			rulings, must be followed.
		</ul>
		<p>When this proposal passes, willarseny will be given the Historian role.
